Rapheal presented @ai_village_dc at DEF CON China and DEF CON 26. Paper in progress

This code demonstrates POC attacks on neural networks at the system level. We have trained models for various problems and demonstrated that we can alter the weight and bias parameters of these models in live memory. We also present methods to retrain the networks to introduce sparse trojans which do not discernably hurt model performance, but cause trojan behavior on select inputs.
